# Human Earing

This piece of code intents to test your earing capabilities by generating waves of increasaing frequency.

Starting from 5Hz and going up to 22KHz, the code will play a sound in your loudspeaker, while printing out the frequency of the sine-wave being played.

Human earing is able to listen to frequencies ranging from 20Hz to 20KHz, depending on each individual, but, as the time pass by, the frequency response tends to be in a norrower range of frequencies.

By executing this code you will be able to discover your frequency response to audible sounds.
